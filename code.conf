	 (8) I'm on the committee and I *still* don't know what the hell
	     #pragma is for.
	 (7) Well, it's an excellent idea, but it would make the compilers too
	     hard to write.
	 (6) Them bats is smart; they use radar.
	 (5) All right, who's the wiseguy who stuck this trigraph stuff in
	     here?
	 (4) How many times do we have to tell you, "No prior art!"

	     sucker.
	 (2) Thank you for your generous donation, Mr. Wirth.
