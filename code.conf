Rebellion Postponement:
	The tendency in one's youth to avoid traditionally youthful
activities and artistic experiences in order to obtain serious career
experience.  Sometimes results in the mourning for lost youth at about
age thirty, followed by silly haircuts and expensive joke-inducing
wardrobes.
		-- Douglas Coupland, "Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture"
