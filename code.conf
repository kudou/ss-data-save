			HOW TO PROVE IT, PART 5

proof by accumulated evidence:
	Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

proof by cosmology:
	The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

proof by mutual reference:
	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in
	reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in
	reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in
	reference A.

proof by metaproof:
	A method is given to construct the desired proof. The
	correctness of the method is proved by any of these
	techniques.
