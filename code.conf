Prevalent beliefs that knowledge can be tapped from previous incarnations or
from a "universal mind" (the repository of all past wisdom and creativity)
not only are implausible but also unfairly demean the stunning achievements
of individual human brains.

  Phenomena", The Skeptical Inquirer, Vol. XII No. 2, ppg. 163-171
