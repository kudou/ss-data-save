There's a lesson that I need to remember
When everything is falling apart
In life, just like in loving
There's such a thing as trying too hard

You've gotta sing
Like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You've gotta dance
Like nobody's watching
It's gotta come from the heart
If you want it to work.
